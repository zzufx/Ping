# This fork
If you happened to get multiple messages that mentioned you in a very short amount of time, you would only see the first one and the rest would never appear (but the sound would still play).

Console complained about:
```
Error executing task
java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: value already present: santa.ping.PingSound@(...)
```
so this fixes that!

**June 13, 2023:** Now this also fixes custom names not working!

A simple Minecraft mod that pings you when you are mentioned in chat, like an IRC client. This mod is completely client-side.

It also has the ability to style chat messages you are mentioned in, allowing underscoring, bolding, italicizing, strikethrough, and all of Minecraft's supported color styles. It adds several new sound types to choose from. Lastly, you can specify custom nick names (separated by semicolon). All of this configuration is done in the Ping! config file.
